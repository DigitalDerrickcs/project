# jspm Project Contribution Guidelines

jspm is only possible through the contributions of users. Contributions to the project are always welcome.

## PR Process

If you are interested in contributing a minor correction or compatibility bug fix, feel free to send a direct PR.

For any larger features, please post a comment or create a relevant issue before starting work or sending a PR. It is important that the implementation details are clear and agreed first where necessary to ensure that effort isn't wasted.
